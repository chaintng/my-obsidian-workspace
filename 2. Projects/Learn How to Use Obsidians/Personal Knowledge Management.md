Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) refers to the process individuals use to collect, organize, and utilize information and knowledge in a way that enhances their learning and productivity. It involves strategies and tools that help individuals capture insights, manage their notes and resources, and facilitate the retrieval of information when needed. PKM emphasizes the importance of self-directed learning and the ability to synthesize knowledge from various sources, enabling individuals to make informed decisions, solve problems, and foster creativity in both personal and professional contexts.
